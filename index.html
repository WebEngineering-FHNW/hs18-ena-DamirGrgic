            <p>My project is an interactive site where Lecturers can create quizzes for their students and get results fast.</p>
            <p>Students can answer these quizzes using this web application.</p>

                        <p>Only the lecturer is required to login. Once the lecturer is logged in, he can access different views and has more options in the web application.</p>
                        <p><i>For example</i>: only when logged in are buttons such as "create quiz" available.</p>
                        <p>Of course, to make sure that the students don't access these through the URLs, there are security checks in place.</p>

                        <p>The UI offers a lightweight look to the website and is easily navigated.</p>
                        <p>For the icons in the forms (create, edit, show), Font Awesome's free Iconset was used. Since this is just a stylesheet however, it is merely linked in the header of main.gsp</p>
                        <p>The standard font should be 'Lato', which is also free and comes from Google Fonts. Like Font Awesome, it is a stylesheet link in main.gsp</p>
                        <p>The website should be fairly responsive. I've made sure to change some little things for phone-users but in the end I didn't have time to go into great detail for everything.</p>

                        <p>No other plugins than the default grails plugins (as well as the Security plugin) have been used, so the project doesn't rely on any major external plugins.</p>
                        <p>However, because I switched from Bootstrap 3 to 4 a year ago, I decided to update the standard Bootstrap version to 4. This was noted in one of the earlier commits.</p>
                        <p>Like stated before, FontAwesome as well as the 'Lato' font were used for this project, both which are free and do not require additional downloads.</p>

                        <p>I didn't have a lot of time left so the tests are not really sophisticated. They are mostly auto-generated using grails' 'generate-all'.</p>
                        <p>There is not much to say here except that I wish I had more time to do these, as it seems they are more useful than I thought they would be.</p>

                <h2>Remarks</h2>
                <p>This project was a lot more work than 18h. Even with the help I received, I had to put in a lot of time to get things working.</p>
                <p>For example, initially I wanted to display the student quiz results in a table. The code for this is in the 'quiz.show' view.
                    I didn't get it working however because of the way I designed the Student Answer domain class.
                    I tried changing this later on, however it was more tedious than I thought, especially considering that I mostly auto-generated
                    the basic functionalities and changing those later on proved to be very annoying.</p>
                <p>I started with a lot of optimism for this project and thought a way to combine Java with Web dev (as I know it) would be very cool, but the structure of grails was very confusing to me.
                At first I could draw similarities from Angular to it, but ultimately it ended up being very different than I thought it would be.</p>
